# Bitsika Console for Merchants - PHP SDK

The Bitsika PHP library gives convenient access to the Console Merchant API for applications written in the PHP language. Devs and merchants alike can use our API and corresponding dashboard to create invoices that any Bitsika user can instantly pay. Learn more here: https://console.bitsika.africa. Our raw API documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12690520/UUy39RrV



## General Requirements
1. PHP version 7.0 or greater.
2. Composer for installing packages.
3. The binding relies on [Guzzle](https://guzzle3.readthedocs.io/index.html) to work fine.

## Installation
Install the Bitsika PHP Library. Version to install is `dev-main`.

```bash
composer require bitsika/merchant-sdk-php
```

Install the latest version of Guzzle.
```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

To use the bindings, use Composer's autoload.
```bash
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```



## Getting Started
To get started, create an instance of the Merchant class. You will need a copy of your Bitsika API `Secret Key`. This can be found on the [Keys and Security page](https://merchant.bitsika.africa/dashboard/merchant/keys-and-security) of our [Console](https://merchant.bitsika.africa/).



```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Bitsika\Merchant;

$merchant = new Merchant('PUT_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE');
```

The variable `$merchant` is now an instance of the Merchant class and can be used to perform any of the multiple tasks available to merchants.

# Merchant Methods
### Get merchant detail.

This method returns basic data related to the merchant company whose `Secret Key` youâ€™re currently using. Data returned includes company name, Bitsika username, profile picture URL, KYC status, balances across multiple currencies and much more.

```php
$response = $merchant->detail();

var_dump($response);
```




### Get merchant statistics.
This method returns transaction statistics pertaining to the respective merchant company. It returns data like number of unique users, sum of successful transactions, sum of all transactions, etc.


```php
$response = $merchant->statistics();

var_dump($response);
```

# Invoice Methods
